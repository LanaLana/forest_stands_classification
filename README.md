# Classifying Tree Species in Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Sampling procedure is highly essential for forest species classification via satellite imagery, especially when convolutional neural-networks are implemented. 
In this repository, combination of pixel-wise and object-wise approaches is presented. It shows promising results for the task where individual stands are available.
